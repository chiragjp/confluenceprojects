    "section": "",
    "text": "Accurate attribution of the areas and populations impacted by climate-related events often relies on distance-based methodologies in which the population of the study unit is assigned temperature data to the closest weather station. We have developed a method that provides a grid-based measure of exposure to extreme heat and cold events called Grid EXposure (GridEX). This approach allows for capturing a more comprehensive representation of thermal comfort and the perceived temperature. GridEX leverages a data science pipeline to gather station-based climatological data and estimate fine-resolution surfaces of ambient (i.e., the air temperature at 2m above the land surface) and apparent temperature (i.e., the perceived temperature by humans, which takes into account humidity and wind in addition to the actual air temperature) with 500x500m resolution. We validated GridEX against station temperature observations from the NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD) and re-analysis climate data provided by GridMET. All the derivative data and the associated source code are publicly available.\nCheck out the GridEX homepage for more information!"

    "text": "Pipeline schematic\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Pipeline to call EHE and ECE\n\n\nWe have developed our dataset in a sequential process illustrated in Fig 1:\n\nData Acquisition: We retrieved a substantial dataset comprising over 800 million historical records of hourly and sub-hourly ambient temperature, dew point, and wind speed, recorded at nearly 2,250 weather stations and provided by NOAA (Fig 1a).\nDaily meteorological parameters computation: We computed the daily average values for ambient temperature, vapor pressure, and wind speed by taking the mean of hourly and sub-hourly raw data at station locations (Fig 1b).\nMissing data imputation: We detected and imputed missing daily records of up to five days gap in the daily time series based on the historical data from the same location (Fig 1c).\nApparent temperature computation: We calculated the average daily apparent temperature (AT) for each station using the method developed by Steadman (Fig 1c). What is AT? Check out our post!\nExcess heat and cold factor computation: We began the extreme event delineation by determining the excess heat and cold factors (EHF/ECF) as measures of temperature anomaly against historical normals (Fig 1d). We identified anomalies by contrasting the rolling average AT of the immediate past three days with the rolling average AT observed during the 30 days leading up to those three days at each station location\nStation-based extreme events identification: Leveraging the EHF/ECF, we identified the instances of extreme heat and cold events at the station locations using relative thresholds according to Sheridan et al. (Fig 1e).\nExtreme events intensity measurement: Using the station-based EHE/ECE daily records, we quantified the intensity of these extreme events by multiplying the duration of extreme heat or cold episodes and their levels of excess heat and cold. As suggested by Fard et al., the resulting Extreme Heat and Cold Magnitude Indicators (EHMI/ECMI) can be used to quantitatively compare the strength of EHE/ECE across geographies, where values closer to zero indicate locations minimally impacted by short-lived extreme conditions. In contrast, values approaching +100 pinpoint the prolonged heat events, and those nearing -100 signify places affected by extended cold events (Fig 1f).\nSpatial interpolation: Based on the intensity values derived for station locations, we spatially interpolated EHMI/ECMI values across the contiguous United States using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method over a high-resolution spatial grid (Fig 1g). IDW was used to assign weights to nearby stations’ measurements (i.e., EHMI/ECMI) inversely proportional to their distances to each grid cell. The weighted values were then averaged to estimate the EHMI/ECMI values for every grid cell, generating the continuous surface.\nArea-wide extreme events determination: Finally, by analyzing the interpolated grids of EHMI/ECMI, we outlined the geographic extent of extreme events daily (Fig 1h).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Statistical distribution of the computed AT for all the stations within the study area (2008 - 2022). The solid red line indicates the overall mean, and the dashed green line denotes the overall median value.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

The workshop helps participants to get started with querying and retrieving the national dataset of EHE/ECE covering the continental United States over the past 15 years. They will also gain experience in linking this catalog with other data sources such as Census ACS. By participating in this workshop, the attendees would be better able to: Learn about opportunities, challenges and possible solutions in leveraging large scale spatio-temporal data for population-based epidemiological health research. Understand the considerations in integrating, maintaining and retrieval of climatological and socio-demographic data from dispersed and heterogeneous data sources. Learn the sources of uncertainty in identifying extreme climate events and the exposed population in such incidents, and understand strategies to minimize the errors in the impacted population classifications. Formulate their personalized approach to adoption of geoinformatics technology and open source softwares for climate related demographic research."

    "text": "Summary\nStudying how climate change affects us requires accurately identifying areas hit by extreme weather, like intense heat waves. Usually, researchers estimate these conditions using data from the nearest weather station, but this method can be inaccurate. A new approach has been developed that better tracks Extreme Heat Events by using a more detailed temperature measure. This improved method is much more precise, correctly identifying about one million more Californians affected by severe heat each day between 2017 and 2021, compared to the old way."

This demographic, which includes a substantial number of Medicare beneficiaries, is notably vulnerable to health issues. This concern is growing as the population of older Americans is projected to nearly double by 2050. Simultaneously, the severity and frequency of extreme environmental changes, such as intense heatwaves and cold spells, are hypothesized to intensify.\nExtreme weather events can significantly impact the health of older adults, children, and those with co-morbid conditions, leading to increased mortality and a higher demand for healthcare services, including hospitalization.\nIt is essential to understand and address the specific health challenges faced by these older adults in the face of confluence of exposome-related events. This understanding is crucial for ensuring that our healthcare system, including Medicare, is prepared to effectively support the growing number of senior citizens in the face of environmental challenges."

GridEx leverages a data science pipeline to gather station-based climatological data and estimate fine-resolution surfaces of ambient temperature which takes into account humidity and wind in addition to the actual air temperature."

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\nGridEX was developed through a sequential processes that involved compiling high-resolution spatio-temporal measures of extreme heat and cold factors. This method is depicted in the informatics diagram below and outlined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Acquisition: A substantial dataset comprising over 800 million historical records of hourly and sub-hourly ambient temperature, dew point, and wind speed, recorded at nearly 2,250 weather stations, was retrieved, as provided by NOAA (Step a).\nDaily meteorological parameters computation: The daily average values for ambient temperature, vapor pressure, and wind speed were computed by taking the mean of hourly and sub-hourly raw data at station locations (Step b).\nMissing data imputation: Missing daily records of up to five days gap in the daily time series were detected and imputed based on the historical data from the same location (Step c).\nApparent temperature computation: The average daily apparent temperature (AT) for each station was calculated using the method developed by Steadman (Step c).\nExcess heat and cold factor computation: The delineation of extreme events began by determining the excess heat and cold factors (EHF/ECF) as measures of temperature anomaly against historical normals (Step d). Anomalies were identified by contrasting the rolling average AT of the immediate past three days with the rolling average AT observed during the 30 days leading up to those three days at each station location.\nStation-based extreme events identification: Using the EHF/ECF, instances of extreme heat and cold events at the station locations were identified using relative thresholds according to Sheridan et al. (Step e).\nExtreme events intensity measurement: The intensity of these extreme events was quantified using the station-based EHE/ECE daily records by multiplying the duration of extreme heat or cold episodes and their levels of excess heat and cold. Following the suggestion by Fard et al., the resulting Extreme Heat and Cold Magnitude Indicators (EHMI/ECMI) were used to quantitatively compare the strength of EHE/ECE across geographies, where values closer to zero indicate locations minimally impacted by short-lived extreme conditions, whereas values approaching +100 pinpoint prolonged heat events, and those nearing -100 signify places affected by extended cold events (Step f).\nSpatial interpolation: Based on the intensity values derived for station locations, EHMI/ECMI values were spatially interpolated across the contiguous United States using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method over a high-resolution spatial grid (Step g). The IDW method was employed to assign weights to nearby stations’ measurements (i.e., EHMI/ECMI) inversely proportional to their distances to each grid cell, and the weighted values were then averaged to estimate the EHMI/ECMI values for every grid cell, generating the continuous surface.\nArea-wide extreme events determination: By analyzing the interpolated grids of EHMI/ECMI, the geographic extent of extreme events was outlined and cataloged (Step h)."
